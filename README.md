Supplementary information for the article, *Self-consistent implementation of locally scaled self-interaction-correction method* (https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0130436)

Molecular and electronic coordinates (i.e. FODs) are included. 
FRMIDT (FODs in bohr formatted for the FLOSIC code input)
SYMBOL (Molecular geometry in bohr formatted for the FLOSIC code input)
fod.xyz (FODs in angstrom formatted for JMOL)
XMOL.xyz (Molecular geometry in angstrom formatted for JMOL)
 
Those FODs are optimized at the self-consistent LSIC-LSDA level of theory.
